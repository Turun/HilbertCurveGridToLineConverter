# HilbertCurveGridToLineConverter

This Programm was inspired by this video: https://www.youtu.be/3s7h2MHQtxc

A Hilbert Curve is a curve/line that goes through every single point on a square grid. If two points are close on the Grid, the probably are too on the line. This program converts a 2D Array (has to be a square and sidelength hat to be a power of two) to a 1D Array, using a Hilbert curve. It can also convert a 1D Array (length has to be a power of four) to a 2D Array.
